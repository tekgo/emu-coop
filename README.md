This directory contains some Lua scripts that, when loaded by a compliant emulator such as snes9x-rr or FCEUX, can synchronize emulator state over the internet (allowing "cooperative" playthroughs of single-player games).

Each game you want to use this with requires a "mode" file in the modes/ directory. Currently included are modes for Link to the Past and the Link to the Past "Randomizer".
